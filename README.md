# vshell

vshell is a simple shell interface written in the C programming
language. It supports input and output redirection, as well
as pipelining. 

The shell emulates a standard Unix terminal, with notations for
redirections as < or > (input and output, respectively). Pipelines
are indicated with a | between commands.
